What do we want out of this?
- Fun 
- Learn & practice
- Something "working" 
- Presentable Product 
- Practice Agile method during the project - standups
- Everyone is on the same page, try to minimise any confusion. 
- Keep on communicating.

Roles:
Decision maker?
Guider of group: Kris
Git Master: Zac
Frontend: Kritika, Rodrigo, Zac
Backend: Koko, Kris 
Floater: Rodrigo

Conflicts:
- If tech: democracy, voting.
- If actual conflict: take a 10-min break. Communicate. stop and talk. and utilise standups.  Respect everyon'es space.

Hours:
- Weekdays same for everyone. If working on weekends, prefer to work remotely (commute time is too much)
    Focus on finishing by Friday night, try not to work on the weekends.
    Have a clear plan how far we CAN go or WANT to go.
    Have Sprints everyday.

Communication:
- Slack. Update everyone! especially working in weekends. 

Backlog board:
- Utilise it like the multiday.

When stressed:
- Kris: when he knows what he's doing, quiet time, quiet head space to do work alone. But if blocked, need someone's eyes.
- Zac: Just work alone, quietly. No distractions.
    Note: we could say to everyone "I'm having a time-out" etc.
    Note2: if we need to pair-up, tell everyone/someone and pairup.
- Kritika: Usually go for walk, space, and eat, instrumental music - focus on work alone.
- Rodrigo: Manage it well generally, takes a break in the middle. 
- Koko: Taking a break. Gets stressed when there is nothing to do, needs to be occupied.
    If waiting, to ask if she can help or check backlog.

Standup agenda: 
- Maybe check in like Carolyn - emotions, of how you're feeling
- 3 times a day:
    Once in the morning, and once after lunch time, and before going home.

How will we survive? 
- Eating - be free - mingle with everyone in the cohort.

If you're stuck on something:
- Keep track on how long you're stuck on it. Utilise toggl?
- Usually 15 mins then ask

To do today: 
- Draw out diagrams and components on how its gonna look like.
- Backlog tickets for down/idletime.

Stretch:
- Learn React-native - build on react
- Deploy CICD
- Testing - think about the tests! when writing anything!

A quick reminder of some of the things you should discuss today :v:
Things to discuss BEFORE planning your project:
- Check in (how are you? How do you feel about working on this larger project?)
- Wellbeing (when Iâ€™m stressed ... I need...) (general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc)
- Expectation setting and agreements (what hours will we keep (factoring in needing to sustain this for a whole week!), what do we do when conflict arises (create your conflict resolution plan for Human Skills!), how will we communicate)
- How will we work (what roles and what agile rituals will we use etc)
- How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)
- How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically
Things to think of WHILE planning your project and AFTER discussing the things above:
- What is your MVP? How much work do you think it will take to achieve it?
- What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? Will you use Redux?
- GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?
- Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas?
- What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen? When will you do the hard tech? Will you go outside as a team?
- Documentation. Set up a repo and a readme, start adding things to it
- Set up a kanban board (To Do, Up Next, In Progress, Done)
- Draw your wireframes, make some user stories
Things to remember in general:
To have fun!
